# CSC3833 Data Visualization Project 
![4 Panel](Images/final.png "16:9 4 panel plot")
Visualization has become a tool both for the exploration of raw data and for the presentation of 
analysed data to end users. In this assignment I am asked to represent my understanding and

three aspects of life in the UK: London and Newcastle housing prices, UK internet speeds, and the top 100
companies share price.
